Multiple Linear Regression & Model Evaluation:
Multiple Linear Regression is a statistical technique that models the relationship between one dependent variable and two or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. This method allows for the prediction of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.

Model Evaluation in the context of regression involves assessing how well the model performs using various metrics like R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These metrics help in determining the accuracy, reliability, and predictive power of the regression model. Model evaluation also includes techniques like cross-validation to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.
